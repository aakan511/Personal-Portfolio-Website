        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h2>High School Student, Aspiring Engineer/Computer Scientist</h2>
        <p>I'm a high school student going into my senior year at Gilman School in Baltimore Maryland. In school, I am passionate about my studies, with my favorite subjects being math and computer science. Outside of school, I enjoy learning about computer science and engineering through projects. Currently, I am able to code in Python, Java, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, as well as some Arduino.</p>
