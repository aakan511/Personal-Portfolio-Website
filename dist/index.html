        <h4>High School Student, Aspiring Engineer/Computer Scientist</h4>

        <p>I'm a high school student going into my senior year at Gilman School in Baltimore, Maryland. My favorite subjects are math and computer science. Outside of school, I enjoy learning about programming, and engineering. This site gives a description of some of my favorite projects and hobbies.</p>  
      <h4>Studied Programming Languages:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>Java</li>
        <li>HTML & CSS</li>
        <li>JavaScript</li>
        <li>Arduino</li>

      <h3>Kibo Robot Programming Challenge</h3>
      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K0OQABZKGOA?start=834" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <h4>Technologies & STEM Concepts Used:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Java</li>
        <li>OpenCV</li>
        <li>Android Studio</li>
        <li>Quaternions</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Around April, I led a team of me and my classmates to win 2nd place nationally in the third year of the Kibo Programming Challenge as team Salcedo. The first place team, Califorina Polytechnic State University's HSTAR, was able to watch their code ran on one of the Astrobee robots in the International Space Station. As the captain, I was responsible for organizing meetings and setting deadlines for each part of the code and helping my teammates as best I could. We were also fortunate enough to be able to work with some college students from Sri Lanka, which was an amazing experience for me because I learned a lot about their culture and programming, and I made some friends on the other side of the globe! In the competition, the main goal is to use image recognition to find and patch air leaks on the ISS.  
        
        This challenge involves learning about image recognition through programming a robot to patch air leaks autonomously on the ISS.</p>

        </ul>
        <!--<img src="/assets/greenhouseTomatoesBig.jpeg" width="60%">-->
        <p>In this project, I co-lead a team of high-schoolers to design an aquaponics system, where fish waste is cycled through rock-based grow beds, resulting in a closed loop system that not only reduces water consumption by 95% compared to traditional agriculture, but also eliminates the need for soil. We also get to give back to the community through our partnership with a local food pantry, where we donate our harvests.</p>

        <h3>My 3D Printing Journey</h3>
        <h4>Technologies & STEM Concepts Used:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Arduino IDE</li>
          <li>C++</li>
          <li>Raspberry Pi</li>
          <li>Soldering</li>

          <li>Slicer software (Ultimaker Cura, Prusaslicer, Superslicer)</li>
          <li>Fluidd</li>
          <li>Klipper</li>
        </ul>
        <p>3D printing is my first advanced STEM hobby. I got my first 3D printer(the CR10S4 in the picture) in 2019 and have been mofyfing it along with another printer I got during the pandemic. 3D printing has helped me learn all facets of engineering - from firmware development to soldering to 3D design.</p>

        <h3>My journey to building a (mostly) good-looking website</h3>
        <img src="/assets/early-website.06e02ece.png">
        <h4>Technologies & STEM Concepts Used:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML</li>

          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>VSCode</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This summer, I decided to undertake an interesting project in computer science, which would challenge me to learn new programming languages(HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). Since beginning this journey, I not only learned about coding a website, but also about network frameworks and how internet websites actually work.  </p>

        </ul>
        <p>One of my favorite hobbies throughout high school has been competitive robotics. Participating in the First Tech Challenge has allowed me to learn robotics and interact with many amazing people, while embracing Gracious Professionalism - embracing kindness.</p>

      <div class="hobbyDescription" id="languages">
        <h3>My (human) languages</h3>
        <p>In addition to STEM, I also enjoy learning human languages because it gives me a different perspective and gives me the ability to collabarate with different people. I learned to speak, read, and write in both Ukranian and Russian from my parents. I'm very thankful to them for teaching me these beautiful languages because I'm now able to read classical Slavik litterature as well as make a deep connection with my Slavik herritage. In middle school, I chose to learn Japanese because I thought it was the most challenging language I could take. While I still have a lot more to learn, I really enjoy learning Japanese because it has highly structured grammar, which is intuitive to me. In high school, I began learning Chinese. I chose Chinese because I realized that I would be able to learn from more than a billion people I wouldn't have been able to learn from otherwise.</p>

      <div class="hobbyDescription" id="acting">
        <h3>Acting and Music</h3>
        <p>While I don't think I will ever become a professional, I have enjoyed participating in several plays over the years. Starting in middle school, I would perform in a Slavik play yearly, which has been a fun, creative outlet.</p>

        <p>I began playing piano when I was about 6 years old. As I kept playing, I became more and more interterested in music and later began playing the classical guitar recreationally. </p>
